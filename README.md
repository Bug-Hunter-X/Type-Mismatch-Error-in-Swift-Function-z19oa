This repository demonstrates a common Swift error: passing an argument of the wrong type to a function.  The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected version. The error arises from trying to multiply an Int with a String. Swift's strict type system prevents implicit conversions, leading to a compile-time error. The solution involves careful type checking and ensuring that arguments passed to functions match the expected types.
